For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

<p align="center" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center;">
  <img src="./images/01.png" style="width: 600px; margin: 25px;"/>
  <img src="./images/02.png" style="width: 500px; margin: 25px"/>
</p>
